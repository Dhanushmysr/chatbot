## Introduction: - Substation Asset Maintenance Chatbot


GridNLP represents a conversational chat bot system engineered to provide indispensable support within the realm of Substation Asset Maintenance. By harnessing the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP), GridNLP adeptly addresses user inquiries pertaining to maintenance procedures, assessment thresholds, issue troubleshooting, safety protocols, and equipment recommendations. Notably, GridNLP remains an ongoing development effort, dedicated to delivering precision, granularity, and insightful feedback to augment the maintenance protocols within the substation industry.
The development framework for this endeavor is founded on tools such as NLTK, PyTorch, and FastAPI for the Python backend, complemented by the utilization of Flutter for mobile application development. The retrieval of responses is orchestrated through advanced techniques, including cosine similarity and tag matching. Additionally, a robust spell checker has been seamlessly integrated into the backend to ensure optimal response quality.

## Getting Started and Installation

GridNLP APK file is available in the release bundle of the repo. For setting up the server or re-configure the setup for your needs, follow the steps:
1. Clone the repo and setup an environment in the directory by running `python -m venv .env`.
2. Activate the environment
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing the packages required for the project. The project was tested and developed for version 3.10>.
4. Now, for custom training , cd to bots and change the `intents.json` for custom responses and `model.py` as per your need. After running `train.py`, the trained file would be present in the models directory.
5. Make necessary changes in the server and run `python server.py` for starting the local server.
6. For using the API, the server is hosted in render.com and the api for QnA could be done by using this : <br> `https://gridnlp.onrender.com/chatbot/?question=<your_query>`
7. For flutter development, cd into flutter/chatbot for accessing the flutter directory.
